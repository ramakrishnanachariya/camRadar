CamRadar
===================
it will measure distance between cam and face
and poltted  on room map(Assume 5*5 feets room )

i assume as  Normal Face Width (KNOWN_WIDTH=.5;	)but u can change in coding also.

1st initialize face width needed.then face tracking Kalman Filter it will ( if face is not detect)tracking 100 sec

S/W  Requirement 
=================
OpenCV 2.4.9
	

How to execute the program
==========================

	Important Note 
	============================
	
	1. Need 1 feet gap between cam and face(1st time only),i hope ur using labtop for initialize face width.
	 2.program will ask Grid(Feet): you have give one value only example if you will give 4 ,then program will take it as 4*4 room
							    <<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
	

execution
=========	
g++ camRadar.cpp -o camRadar `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv`
./camRadar


1st Time Intialiize
 Please Keep away from camera (exact 1 feet)

Grid(Feet): 4    // ( 4*4 feet)
